<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="the-question">The question</h3>

<p><em>This essay was written in response to a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/753640/discussions/0/3053988806900327733/?tscn=1631567380#c3035978150308653414">question</a> I received on Steam discussions forum dedicated to the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>.<br />
The innocuous question, unrelated to the thread’s main topic, stands as follows:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just curious, why you didn’t like the ending?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>This was sufficient indulgement to put my occasional graphomaniac drive into this analysis.</em></p>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>

<p>Before I get into it, though, it’s worth noting that I’m a big fan of the game — to say <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> is decidedly my cup of tea wouldn’t be enough…<br />
But I’m here to criticize the ending, not praise the game.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what: credit where it’s due, it was an ending to surpass many others, at least conceptually.<br />
And perhaps I wouldn’t complain, would it be an ending of a worse game.<br />
But all throughout the ending sequence, I couldn’t help but look back on how much I enjoyed every bit of the game and how none of this ending feels anything alike.</p>

<p>Let’s set the record straight…<br />
It’s not strictly about what happens in the ending: a major part of my disaffection for the canon ending is in how the many trains of thought running through the entire rest of the game come crashing down into a ravine of disappointing revelations.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
I’ll be your train conductor on this trip and we’re about to leave the station.<br />
But first, check your seatbelts…</p>

<h3 id="major-spoiler-warning">MAJOR SPOILER WARNING</h3>

<p>Anybody reading forth is expected to have completed their journey through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a>.</p>

<p>Being a mystery game, where your only persistent progression is knowledge, which you can complete in about 15 minutes right out of the gate if you already know what’s up, not only would reading this before you’ve beaten it rob you of the mystery but could also lessen the challenge considerably, even if I’m focusing mainly on metaphysics. You’ve been warned.</p>

<p>I’m about to discuss said metaphysics in levels progressively approaching the very ending in question.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h3>

<p>The universe has come to its natural physical end but there is this unnatural contraption sending memories back in time for a stream of consciousness bound to this recursive memory to re-experience the last moments of the universe.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Since it’s only the memory that gets sent back, the fate of the universe is already sealed.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> <strong>A very natural thing for a universe to go through, so nothing wrong there.</strong></p>

<p>The apparent issue that motivates our explorer’s actions through the course of the game is the anguish of this memory-bound stream of consciousness being trapped in a loop. Breaking said loop once the novelty wears off is only a self-serving matter of attaining personal peace from this torment.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Now since I can’t know Hatchling’s own philosophical makeup and thus their ideal of peace, I, as a player acting on behalf of the protagonist’s memory-bound consciousness stream, have to channel my own: <strong>my headcanon ending would be yanking the advanced warp core and lighting a marshmallow off the supernova at Rieback’s camp.</strong><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> But if you do that — the game doesn’t mechanically complete and rather treats this as a soft failstate.</p>

<h3 id="the-eye">The Eye</h3>

<h4 id="nature">Nature</h4>

<p>The nature of The Eye isn’t ever actually explained.<br />
The divine interpretation is staring us in the eyes, so let’s get on with sorting that out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not quite god, since it needs a conscious observer to collapse <u>the everything</u> at once, that it is, into something that it would manifest as.</li>
  <li>But then also the nature of its agency isn’t explained either, yet it did send out precisely one signal to kick off a series of events that would lead to the ending, as far as we know, so there is a grand plan.</li>
  <li>And the locality of The Eye is never explained either: why’d it have to hold this one specific place in the universe?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="paradoxes">Paradoxes</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Agency heavily implies consciousness, but why would The Eye need another conscious observer to collapse then? Is it not an observer then? Does this indicate reproductive dimorphism of the universe?</p>

    <p>I’m guessing the answer lies in the heavily implied fiction: it seems very much like the protagonist not only collapses quantum phenomena by observing it, but also influences the outcomes with what’s familiar to them from own life experience. It’s less of collapsing a quantum phenomena based on probability and more based on metaphysical personal spirit.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

    <p>That would mean The Eye needs the lived conscious experiences of an inhabitant of the old universe to influence how the new one is created. Perhaps that makes it better in some way, <em>more fun maybe</em>, each new universe having its own flavor.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is localized, then how come there’s a star so close? It would be the epicenter of a Big Bang from which all the matter in the universe ejected outwards from. It would be the least likely place to have anything but true vacuum left, especially considering accelerating universe expansion.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

    <p>I guess a hypothesis could be made that The Eye does not reside in the center of the universe as I doubtfully implied above, but rather plans its own formation somewhere in the next universe through butterfly effect by affecting the minute initial parameters of the Big Bang.</p>

    <p>That itself would imply two things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Eye somehow consumes and condenses all matter (dispersed by supernovae or otherwise) in the last universe, including itself to create the next Big Bang. <em>Which would be pretty tough to explain through physics alone without invoking divine magic tropes.</em></li>
      <li>The next conscious observer (as well as any needed prodding signal[s]) for another universe reset is planned at this stage.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan B of The Eye in case the conscious observer isn’t willing is never explained.</p>

    <p>Despite all implicit determinism the game operates with in its story and obviously having a canon intended ending, it’s also beholden to free will given the game medium to put a player in control. But that also means I’m going to hold it accountable to, <em>ahem</em>, account for free will at least on the surface level of its lore.</p>

    <p>To flesh out the nature of The Eye, it would help to know if the universe would indeed just end for good if the protagonist refused the fate’s invitation to fuse with it or if The Eye (or other entities?) have other ways to reignite the flame.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-eye-verdict">The Eye verdict</h4>

<p>An incomplete quantum quasi-god.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Global, being the one “alpha and omega”, but <strong>not omnipresent</strong>, since localized.</li>
  <li>Deterministically planned everything, but <strong>not omniscient</strong>, since not an observer.</li>
  <li>Can manifest as anything at all, but <strong>not omnipotent</strong>, since requires a willing conscious observer to become complete and act.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tough to feel any empathy for or camaraderie with an incomprehensible super-being in the eldritch sense.</p>

<h3 id="the-end">The end</h3>

<p>Okay, right off the bat…<br />
Why is there a badly lit decrepit observatory with Nomai artifacts removed? It’s based off my memory of the place but altered with unknown intent.<br />
That was the first moment when it felt like The Eye is toying with you, showing who’s in control, who’s the boss here, demonstrating how, now that you’re in its timeless grasp, it can trap you in an endless unpredictable horror show with the added bonus of weaponizing your own memories against you.<br />
<em>Only a possibility, supposedly unfulfilled, but still a corner I didn’t need to turn.</em><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<p>From about this point on it is impossible to tell whether any of what you’re experiencing has any bearing at all on the material world outside of protagonist’s own mindspace — could all be a hallucination experienced as you die for all we know. <em>And it doesn’t exactly look like a happy hallucination either.</em></p>

<p>I can’t stress this enough: <strong>whatever comes next just can’t be gratifying if it’s already indistinguishable from a fever dream. You could never be sure any of this ever actually happened.</strong></p>

<p>Then you’re almost literally chasing shadows in a patch of woods. If this was a celebration of the end of an era and a start of a new one, of creation, of life, of sentience — why’d it have to all be so gloomy? <em>I can get behind gloom when it’s for an according cause.</em></p>

<p>…I guess there’s always a Halloween before New Year’s celebration, to mix cultural references.</p>

<p>Now you got your whole band together and they console you with their sweet little quips but none of it feels genuine, because you know for certain they all perished in a supernova, their bodies scattered to the solar winds… And while the quantum phenomena of The Eye can manifest as any of them once collapsed as corporeal as ever but poofed straight out of nothingness, it’s just not at all the same as the real people who got here through the constant struggle of existence since their birth.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but feel guilty towards each of them, since they got no say in any of this, didn’t cause any of this and weren’t even aware of any of this.</p>

<p>Then when, for example, Feldspar, who knew nothing of the loop, the supernova, The Eye, <em>etc.</em> the last time you saw them for real, acts as if he’s totally in on it — that starts feeling like… betrayal for a lack of a better word, because The Eye is using their image to get under your skin and coax you into completing the deed.</p>

<p>I’d ask why are they even there, but going back to first <a href="#paradoxes">paradox of The Eye analysis</a>, this must be an <em>(unconscious?)</em> projection of Hatchling’s memory to set the scenery for conjuring a Big Bang in tandem with The Eye. This might be the protagonist’s own intuitive semantic metaphor for them assisting him on his way to all of this.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>I shudder to think what fringe delusional state of mind Hatchling must be in and how they, for one, perceive time during all of this without any solid material landmarks of locality and temporality to anchor one’s mind to…</p>

<p>It’s never about any physical danger, mind you, since in the face of the imminent universal extinction event going on, this pilot’s body was only a vessel for delivering an observing consciousness into The Eye.</p>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>The memory-loop-bound conscious process we play as escapes a predictable looping prison of its own mind and saves the protagonist’s body it inhabits from obliteration by supernova only to enter an unpredictable quantum prison of its own mind facing inevitable obliteration by Big Bang never attaining any control over its own fate.</p>

<p>If none of it could be proven real, how am I supposed to feel good about things that might’ve never occurred?</p>

<p>Were it not for mechanical completion of the game (and a great deal of curiosity), I’d probably never enter The Eye were I in protagonist’s shoes. Just think what unimaginable horrors could that entail with immeasurable possibilities at hand sicced at a mere mortal mind with no safeguards, no rules set nor a safeword. That decrepit observatory scene was but a taste.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the clash of quantum fairy tale and implications of inevitable fate, that culminated in the ending, made me salty with how the game doesn’t even try to meaningfully justify merging determinism with quantum probabilistics.</p>

<hr />

<p>As a sidenote: I find the nature of Dark Bramble very much underexplored.</p>
