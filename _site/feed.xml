xml:base="https://erquint.github.io/ccc/outer-wilds-ending-review.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you what… the ending of this game absolutely trumps the endings of so many other good games, at least conceptually.
But I find it woefully sub-par to the level the rest of the game has set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAJOR SPOILER WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the scene, the universe has come to its natural physical end but there is this unnatural contraption sending memories back in time for a stream of consciousness bound to this recursive memory to re-experience the last moments of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We could go into branching timelines hypothesis, which would mean that for every loop there is a dead universe and for each after Ash Twin Project success there’s also an obliterated protagonist but that’s beside the point for the most part, so I’ll try to ignore that. But even without splicing timelines, one could argue that there’s a (factorial of the loop count after success) number of consciousness streams that ceased to bind to the memory loop at one point or another and were just snuffed out with the universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s only the memory that gets sent back, the fate of the universe is already sealed. &lt;em&gt;And it could even be argued that it was sealed from the point of origin of the universe itself, considering determinism.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A very natural thing for a universe to go through, so nothing wrong there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent issue that motivates the protagonist’s actions is the anguish of this memory-bound stream of consciousness being trapped in a loop. Breaking said loop once the novelty wears off is only a self-serving matter of attaining personal peace from this torment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could even go as far as to call it ruthless egoism, considering that Gabbro seems to be enjoying their timeloop vacation to a degree and the protagonist disregards that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now since I can’t know the protagonist’s own philosophical makeup and thus their ideal of peace, I, as a player acting on behalf of the protagonist’s memory-bound consciousness stream, have to channel my own: &lt;strong&gt;my headcanon ending would be tossing the advanced warp core into space and lighting a marshmallow off the supernova at Rieback’s capm.&lt;/strong&gt; But if you do that — the game doesn’t mechanically complete and rather treats this as a soft failstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also uncertain if Solanum is willing to end their own seemingly timeless quantum existence (assuming the universe reset wipes the quantum moon), although it’s likely, being a curious apostle of The Eye, that they’d support any conscious observer entering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for The Eye…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of The Eye isn’t ever actually explained.
Not quite God, since it needs a conscious observer to collapse &lt;strong&gt;the everything&lt;/strong&gt; at once that it is into something that it would manifest as.
But then also the nature of its agency isn’t explained either, yet it sent precisely one signal to kick off a series of events that would lead to the ending, so there is a grand plan.
And the locality of The Eye is never explained either: why’d it have to hold this one specific place in the universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we start running into paradoxes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agency heavily implies consciousness, but why would The Eye need another conscious observer to collapse then? Is it not an observer then? Does this indicate reproductional dimorphism of the universe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing the answer lies in the heavily implied fiction: it seems very much like the protagonist not only collapses quantum phenomena by observing it, but also influences the outcomes with what’s familiar to them from own life experience.
&lt;em&gt;That concept is so riddled with holes one could pick at endlessly, but given that in actual physics science there’s not even anything about an observer having to be conscious (photon detectors aren’t conscious…), I’m willing to just accept it as a fiction device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would mean The Eye needs the lived conscious experiences of an inhabitant of the old universe to influence how the new one is created. Perhaps that makes it better in some way, more fun maybe, each new universe having its own flavor. &lt;em&gt;Even though the sequence of those flavors has to be predetermined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it is localized, then how come there’s a star so close: the epicenter of a Big Bang from which all the matter in the universe ejected outwards from. It would be the least likely place to have anything but true vacuum left, especially considering accelerating universe expansion. &lt;em&gt;Maybe full vaccum rather, in quantum foam sense…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess a hypothesis could be made that The Eye does not reside in the center of the universe as I doubtfully implied above, but rather plans its own formation somewhere in the next universe through butterly effect by affecting the minute initial parameters of the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That itself would imply two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It somehow consumes all matter in the last universe, including itself to create the next Big Bang.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next conscious observer (as well as any needed prodding signals) for another universe reset is planned at this stage.
(Yep, that’s determinism again. I’m just salty with how the game doesn’t even try justify merging determinism with quantum phenomena.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan B of The Eye in case the conscious observer isn’t willing is never explained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all determinism the game operates with in its story and obviously having a canon intended ending, it’s also beholden to free will given the game meduim to put a player in control. But that also means it needs its lore to account for free will at least on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To flesh out the nature of The Eye, it would help to know if the universe would indeed just end for good if the protagonist refused the fate’s invitation or if The Eye (or other entities?) have other ways to reignite the flame. The isolation ending cuts too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incomplete quantum God.
Global, being the one alpha and omega, but not omnipresent, since localized.
Deterministically planned everything, but not omnicient, since not an observer.
Can manifest as anything at all, but not omnipotent, since requires a willing conscious observer to become complete and act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the actual meat of the ending…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there a badly lit decrepit observatory with Nomai artefacts removed? That was the first moment when it felt like The Eye is toying with you, showing who’s in control, who’s the boss here, demonstrating how, now that you’re in its timeless grasp, it can trap you in an endless unpredictable horror show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From about this point on it is impossible to tell whether any of what you’re experiencing has any bearing at all on the material world outside of protanonist’s own mindspace — could all be a hallucination experienced as you die for all we know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you’re almost literally chasing shadows in a patch of woods. If this was a celebration of the end of an era and a start of a new one, of creation, of life, of sentience — why’d it have to all be so gloomy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I guess there’s always a Halloween before New Year’s celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you got your whole band together and they comfort you with their sweet little quips but none of it feels genuine, because you know for certain they all perished in a supernova, their bodies scattered to the solar winds… And while the quantum phenomena of The Eye can manifest as any of them once collapsed as corporeal as ever but poofed straight out of nothingness, it’s just not at all the same as the real people who got here through the constant struggle of existence since their birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but feel guilty towards each of them, since they got no say in any of this, didn’t cause any of this and weren’t even aware of any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when, for example, Feldspar, who knew nothing of the loop, the supernova, The Eye, etc. the last time you saw them for real, acts as if he’s totally in on it — that starts feeling like… betrayal for a lack of a better word, because The Eye is using their image to get under your skin and coax you into completing the deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d ask why are they even there, but going back to point 1 of The Eye analysis, this must be an equivalent of a protagonist’s fever dream where they just thought of the crew when they were settling into this whole quantum revelation by collapsing quantum phenomena to set the scenery for conjuring a Big Bang in tandem with The Eye. This must be the protagonist’s own intuitive semantic metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then they’re nothing more than effectively figments of his imagination no matter how corporeal, since it’s the projections reflecting the protagonist’s own perception and memory of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shudder to think what fringe delusional state of mind the protagonist must be in and how they perceive time during all of this without any solid material landmarks of locality and temporality to anchor one’s mind on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never about any physical danger, mind you, since in the face of the imminent universal extinction event going on, the protagonist’s body was only a vessel for carrying the consciousness into The Eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory-loop-bound conscious process we play as escapes a predictable looping prison of its own mind and saves the protagonist’s body it inhabits from obliteration by supernova only to enter an unpredictable quantum prison of its own mind facing inevitable obliteration by Big Bang never attaining any control over its own fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to put an accent on the “unpredictable quantum prison of its own mind”. I find that concept so eerily undesirable that I found myself afraid of it being the case ever since I first started learning about The Eye. Imagine my “surprise” when by the end I find that it is exactly the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for mechanical completion of the game (and a great deal of curiosity), I’d probably never enter The Eye were I in protagonist’s shoes. Just think what unimaginable horrors could that entail with immeasurable possibilities at hand sicced at a mere mortal mind with no safeguards, no rules set nor safeword. That decrepit observatory scene was but a taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sidenote: I find the nature of Dark Bramble very much underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again for good measure…
