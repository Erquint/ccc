I oughtta give a better description later, but for now, let's disambiguate the title and direction.
* Commie stands for my Stalinist outlook on politics, socio-economics and culture.
* Coder stands for my Rubyist outlook on coding, assembly debugging and IT as a whole.
* Colony stands for indie-gamer outlook on gaming, related media and the industry.
Has to do with my appreciation of the colony-management genre among many others.
